I started reading about something called CCNA Routing and Switching (Cisco Certified Network Associate). I seen some videos of people using a virtual network simulator called GNS3. Call it fate, coincidence or a small world but I was working with Python and pyQT just last week; GNS3 is built with python and pyQT. I didn’t feel the need to write about what I was working on because it was, and still is, an experimental side project for this site. I am still using dialog for bash, and some python; and right now, it is still a spaghetti of a mess that I am scared to touch at the moment.

If I were to rate which one is considered play and which is considered work I would say, from play to work, networking (because I love hardware — I think), GNU/Linux then Programming. I will be honest. I am lazy.
