      Creating a todo list today. I need to get some projects off of my mind and focus on what projects I shouldn’t be starting or serve as a distraction. 

It all started when I seen the raspberry pi today. It looks so lonely. So, I have decided to start some fall cleaning sweeping: removing unused equip

      I always used echo $SHELL to return the current shell. Going over some studying material I rediscovered echo $0. This positional parameter, $0, assigns the current shell into that shell variable.
